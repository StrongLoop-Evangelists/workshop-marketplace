# Link your persistent datasource

We're going to be setting up model objects to be transferred across our API, but to keep track of them, we'll need a persistent datasource to stash them in.

Go to your command line in the root directory we've been working in, type `lb datasource`, and you'll see the following:

### Make a name for your datasource

```
? Enter the data-source name: ComposeMongo
```

After you type in this name, you'll be presented with a list of database connectors that Loopback works with. 

For this workshop, we've created a database using [compose.io](https://compose.io) that you can use to work with.

Use your arrow buttons to scroll through the choices, and select `MongoDB (supported by StrongLoop)`.

### Choose MongoDB for your datasource

```
? Select the connector for ComposeMongo:
  IBM Cloudant DB (supported by StrongLoop)
  IBM DB2 for z/OS (supported by StrongLoop)
  Redis key-value connector (supported by StrongLoop)
‚ùØ MongoDB (supported by StrongLoop)
  MySQL (supported by StrongLoop)
  PostgreSQL (supported by StrongLoop)
  Oracle (supported by StrongLoop)
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

Loopback lets you configure datasources with ease. The first prompt will be for a connection string, which should be filled out like so:

### Enter MongoDB connection string
```
? Connection String url to override other settings (eg: mongodb://username:password@hostname:port/database): mongodb://productAdmin:loopback123@aws-us-east-1-portal.26.dblayer.com:17243,aws-us-east-1-portal.24.dblayer.com:17243/marketplaceDemo?ssl=true
```

Loopback will then prompt you for 5 other fields. Since we entered the full connection string, we can hit Enter for each field, as we don't need it, but this illustrates for you that you can enter the raw information if you don't have a connection string to copy and paste.

### Choose datasource information
```
? host:
? port:
? user:
? password:
? database:
```

The next prompt should ask if you want to install the MongoDB connector. Enter `y` to let `npm install` do it's thing.

And you're all set! In the next step, we're going to show you how to start creating a model object, and take advantage of the datasource you've linked up.
